3. setup.py
   ```python
   from setuptools import setup, find_packages

   setup(
       name="ollama_agents_knowledge",
       version="0.1.0",
       packages=find_packages(where="src"),
       package_dir={"": "src"},
       install_requires=[

   ```

4. src/kb_graph/__init__.py
   ```python
   from .graph_operations import *
   from .schema import *
   ```

5. src/knowledge_extraction/__init__.py
   ```python
   from .extractor import *
   ```

6. src/memory_search/__init__.py
   ```python
   from .search import *
   ```

For the other Python files (graph_operations.py, schema.py, extractor.py, search.py, and the test files), you'll need to review and possibly refactor the code from your original Ollama_Agents project. Here are some general steps:

1. Review the imported modules in each file and update them to reflect the new package structure.
2. Ensure that any dependencies between these modules are correctly handled.
3. If there are any hard-coded paths or references to other parts of the original Ollama_Agents project, update them accordingly.
4. In the test files, update import statements and any setup/teardown procedures to work with the new structure.

Lastly, create a .gitignore file with standard Python ignores:
